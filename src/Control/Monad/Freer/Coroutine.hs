-- | A type representing a yielding of control.

-- Type variables have following meaning:
--
-- [@a@]
--   The current type.
--
-- [@b@]
--   The input to the continuation function.
--
-- [@c@]
--   The output of the continuation.

  deriving (Functor)

-- | Lifts a value and a function into the Coroutine effect.
yield :: Member (Yield a b) effs => a -> (b -> c) -> Eff effs c
yield x f = send (Yield x f)

-- | Represents status of a coroutine.
data Status effs a b r
    = Done r
    -- ^ Coroutine is done with a result value of type @r@.
    | Continue a (b -> Eff effs (Status effs a b r))
    -- ^ Reporting a value of the type @a@, and resuming with the value of type
    -- @b@, possibly ending with a value of type @x@.

-- | Reply to a coroutine effect by returning the Continue constructor.

-- | Launch a coroutine and report its status, without handling (removing)
-- 'Yield' from the typelist. This is useful for reducing nested coroutines.
